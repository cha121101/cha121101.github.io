                Attack on Titan (Japanese: 進撃の巨人, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit. 'The Advancing Giant') is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. 
                It is set in a world where humanity is forced to live in cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating humanoids referred to as Titans; 
                the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after they bring about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. 
                It was serialized in Kodansha's monthly magazine Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine from September 2009 to April 2021, with its chapters collected in 34 tankōbon volumes. 

                An anime television series was produced by Wit Studio (seasons 1–3) and MAPPA (season 4). A 25-episode first season was broadcast from April to September 2013, 
                followed by a 12-episode second season broadcast from April to June 2017. A 22-episode third season was broadcast in two parts, with the first 12 episodes airing 
                from July to October 2018 and the last 10 episodes airing from April to July 2019. A fourth and final season premiered in December 2020, airing 16 episodes in its first part. 
                A second part consisting of 12 episodes aired from January to April 2022, and a third and final part will air in two halves; the first half will premiere in March 2023.

                Attack on Titan has become a critical and commercial success. As of September 2022, the manga had over 110 million copies in circulation, 
                making it one of the best-selling manga series of all time. It has won several awards, including the Kodansha Manga Award, the Attilio Micheluzzi Award, and the Harvey Award. </description>

            <description> 
                    Yuuta Takemoto, a sophomore at an arts college, shares a cheap apartment with two 
                    seniors—the eccentric Shinobu Morita, who keeps failing to graduate due to his absenteeism, 
                    and the sensible Takumi Mayama, who acts as a proper senior to Takemoto, often looking out for him.
                    Takemoto had not given much thought to his future until one fine spring day,
                    when he meets the endearing Hagumi Hanamoto and falls in love at first sight.
                    Incredibly gifted in the arts, Hagumi enrolls in Takemoto's university and soon befriends the
                    popular pottery student Ayumi Yamada. Ayumi is already well acquainted with the three flatmates and
                    secretly harbors deep feelings for one of them.
                    Hachimitsu to Clover is a heartwarming tale of youth, love, soul-searching, and self-discovery,
                    intricately woven through the complex relationships between five dear friends.
